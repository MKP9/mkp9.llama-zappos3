				<p>
					Llama's are known for being a big part of the South American culture, and are
					really common in Peru.

				<p>
					Llama's can carry a good portion of their own weight for up to 8 miles, and have a 
					wonderful wool exterior that be used for clothing.

				<h2 id="llamaEducation">Llama Education</h2>
				<p>Llama's are trained at a very young age to power through tough times.  Similar to the
				   sherpas that haul climbers gear up Mt. Everest, llama's haul the data for Zappos.  They 
				   go through rigorous education and technical training in order to be the best of the best.
				   Upon graduation from Llama high and Llama University, they begin a glorious journey
				   hauling Zappos data to the front lines, fending off intruders with vicious spit.

				<h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
				<p>
					My education as of thus far includes my first degree from Bellevue Community 
					College, now known as Bellevue College.  This was my AAS, originaly geared towards 
					Computer Science,then changed to General Studies.  I switched over to studies in 
					Real Estate and shortly after focused on a career in mangement.
					As of 2016, I have gone back to college at Green River College.  I am pursuing my
					BAS in Software Development.  As of the end of summer quarter 2016, I completed 
					all of my pre-req's and will begin fall quarter 2016 as a Junior in the Software
					Development program at Green River College.
					
					I developed this site based on several assignments I had a few weeks ago in my HTML/CSS
					class.  I tried to utilize several things that I learned in the short 8-weeks.  I am excited
					to begin a career in front end development because of a sense of fulfillment, and being able
					to showcase your work.  Whether it be a finished website or great looking code, this type of
					work is very satisfying and gratifying!
